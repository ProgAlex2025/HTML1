        <h3>Travels</h3>

       <div>
        <h4>To Finland-Estonia</h4>
        <p> When I was 6 years old, I went with my father and mother from St. Petersburg to Helsinki, the capital of Finland. When we stopped at a gas station, I ate a hot dog and I could feel the vacation coming! At the entrance to Helsinki, I fell asleep. Soon my dad and I took the ferry to Estonia, which was very cool. There I visited the Museum of Marine Technology and the city center. There I climbed a high tower. But we spent only 2 days there and returned to Helsinki, where I visited the island where the defenses used to stand. Then I went to Russia. </p>

        <h4>To Mexico</h4>
        <p>In Mexico, I started my tour of Mexico City. There I visited the former palace of the king and took a walk in their main park. Then I drove south through Mexico. I've seen a lot of Mayan ruins, but the coolest thing is to fly over them in a hot air balloon! I soon arrived at a town near the sea, but that was not the end of the journey. From there I went to 7 wonder of the world! At first I climbed at night to all the places that can not be seen in the daytime, and then in the daytime I looked at them, which looked at me majestically, but soon I went to the sea and just rested there, which was pleasant and good for me after a long journey…</p>

        <h3>Important moments</h3>

       <div>
        <h4>First step to Maths</h4>
        <p>Once my mother took me to an amazing class, where I first learned this amazing art, which was started by the great Greek philosophers, namely mathematics. It was in that class that I first learned about Dirichlet, induction, and so on. I was involved in this circle from the age of 6 to the age of 12. After that, the circle already collapsed, but I continued to study with teachers until now. But the first knowledge happened at the age of 6, when I first learned about mathematics.

        <h4>Dream about new school</h4>
        <p>I went to a very ordinary school with soulful teachers, but my knowledge, which by the age of 13 was off the scale for that school, required a new challenge. I decided to enroll in one of the coolest schools - school 179. From that moment on, I began to prepare hard. Pretty soon my dream came true, because I was able to enroll in an engineering class!

          <h4>Biology proects</h4>
          <p>In my last school, I often had projects about different animals. Back then, I didn't make them myself at all, but learned from my mother how to make them. But I always knew how to tell them to show everything and everything, and they always gave me a 5!          </p>
