        <h4>To Finland-Estonia</h4>
        <p> When I was 6 years old, I went with my father and mother from St. Petersburg to Helsinki, the capital of Finland. When we stopped at a gas station, I ate a hot dog and I could feel the vacation coming! At the entrance to Helsinki, I fell asleep. Soon my dad and I took the ferry to Estonia, which was very cool. There I visited the Museum of Marine Technology and the city center. There I climbed a high tower. But we spent only 2 days there and returned to Helsinki, where I visited the island where the defenses used to stand. Then I went to Russia. </p>

        <h4>To Mexico</h4>
        <p>In Mexico, I started my tour of Mexico City. There I visited the former palace of the king and took a walk in their main park. Then I drove south through Mexico. I've seen a lot of Mayan ruins, but the coolest thing is to fly over them in a hot air balloon! I soon arrived at a town near the sea, but that was not the end of the journey. From there I went to 7 wonder of the world! At first I climbed at night to all the places that can not be seen in the daytime, and then in the daytime I looked at them, which looked at me majestically, but soon I went to the sea and just rested there, which was pleasant and good for me after a long journeyâ€¦</p>
